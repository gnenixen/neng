[__MEM_CONTROL_HARD]
In given mode every operation with memory will be controlled and checked before access,
turn off in release mode please, because really slow down game, use only for debug
proposes.

[__MEM_CONTROL_RAW]
Ok, its your life, no checks, no control, just return true on every Memory.isValid call,
excepts if Memory.isValid( null ). I will NEVER use this version, just mind it:)
